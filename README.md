# Penetreation Testing with Kali Linux & OSCP Certification

Resources used while prepareing for and during the PWK Lab  --> 54/54 lab boxes rooted, 4/5 exam hosts* 


3 months out:
- I purchased a VIP subscription to hackthebox (HTB) and worked my way through some of the recommended boxes. I worked my way from the easier boxes to the harder ones. At first I would follow along with IppSec's videos, eventually leading to only watching the videos when I got stuck or after I rooted the box to see what I might have missed.

- I also purchased a 3 month subscription to virtualhackinglabs (VHL). In retrospect a month of VHL would have been enough. However, at the $100/month price just buy a year of HTB VIP instead (unless you're looking to spend money). HTB offers a lot more content that you'll be able to take advantage of after passing OSCP.

- It was recommend to also try a list of vulnhub VMs, however after failing to get the first 3 to work (networking) I gave up on the the vulnhub list.

1 week out:
- At this point I had around 20 boxes rooted in HTB and another 26 in VHL. I felt like I had a good beginner knowledge base for the upcoming lab. At this point I downloaded the PWK VM, set it up to my liking (config files, settings, NO UPDATES, etc) and took the rest fo the week off to relax.

0 day: 2 Mar 19
- The first 8 days of my time was spent going through the pdf, exerecises and videos. I'd read a chapter in the pdf, watch the videos, and do the exercises in that order. I wasn't able to finish all exercises in thoese 9 days, but I did continue working on them randomly when I needed a break from the lab. Eventually I got them all finished and documented for the extra points (I'd NOT recommend going for the 5 points, for myself it took almost 2 days to document and format the report). On day 9 I rooted my first lab machine and finished all the exercises.

Jumping in! 11 Mar - 11 Apr

# Penetreation Testing with Kali Linux & OSCP Certification

Resources used while prepareing for and during the PWK Lab  --> 54/54 lab boxes rooted, 4/5 exam hosts* 


3 months out:
- I purchased a VIP subscription to hackthebox (HTB) and worked my way through some of the recommended boxes. I worked my way from the easier boxes to the harder ones. At first I would follow along with IppSec's videos, eventually leading to only watching the videos when I got stuck or after I rooted the box to see what I might have missed.

- I also purchased a 3 month subscription to virtualhackinglabs (VHL). In retrospect a month of VHL would have been enough. However, at the $100/month price just buy a year of HTB VIP instead (unless you're looking to spend money). HTB offers a lot more content that you'll be able to take advantage of after passing OSCP.

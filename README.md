# Penetreation Testing with Kali Linux & OSCP Certification

Resources used while prepareing for and during the PWK Lab.


3 months out:
- I got a VIP subscription to hackthebox (HTB) and worked my way through some of the recommended boxes. Later on TJ_Null put together a graphic
- https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/612/oscp-practice
- https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/alf4nf/oscp_like_boxes_on_hack_the_box_credit_tj_null_on/

- I also got a 3 month subscription to virtualhackinglabs (VHL). In retrospect a month of VHL would have been enough. However, at the $100/month price just buy a year of HTB VIP instead (unless you're looking to spend money). HTB offers a lot more that you'll be able to take advantage of after passing OSCP.
